## What is QLeo?

QLeo provides the necessary data to ensure that your applicationâ€™s GraphQL data fetching architecture is set up for the most optimized results. For every mutation and query, we have graphical representation of key metrics including the time a resolver takes as well as number of times it was fired. Simply upload your GraphQL schema and QLeo will identify where you can make improvements for efficiency and speed.

## How to Use

Once downloaded, simply upload your schema by clicking 'Upload'. 

After the schema is uploaded, metrics will populate for the provided schema: queries, mutations, and resolvers.

There are two key metrics for resolver performance, time and number of times fired. Performance will be indicated on by graphical representation.

For longer query times and multiple firings, we recommend looking into the Data Loader tool to batch queries and improve efficiency
